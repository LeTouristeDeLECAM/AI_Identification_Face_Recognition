# AI_Identification_Face_Recognition
 This project is taking part in larger school project where we implement a photo-gallery identification
 This have to interpret as a peace of proof 

# Data set :
The Dataset is MeGlass, all the face images are selected and cleaned from MegaFace.
We used the version composed of copped images 120x120.
